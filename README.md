# FoodOrderingSystem

This project was developed for an academic work of the course CST8218 - Web Application Programming - of Algonquin College (Ottawa, CA).

As the name says, it is a multiligual food ordering system developed using pure Java EE, where the user can put goods in a cart and then checkout.
What makes it different is that the order status can be changed at any time by the cook, the manager or the delivery guy, and the customer can see all this changes and follow where the order is (with timestamps!).

Webserver used: Tomcat 8.0
